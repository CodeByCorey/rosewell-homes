                                We hired this company to convert our one-window
                                reception to a two-window reception. We were
                                able to quickly schedule an initial consult
                                where Eric was able to take our rather vague
                                ideas and develop a design plan that was exactly
                                what we wanted. He asked many questions and
                                brought up issues we had not considered, which
                                showed the depth of his knowledge. We quickly
                                received a detailed estimate that was
                                near/slightly below what we had been expecting.
                                We were able to schedule the work so that it
                                would not interfere with our regular business
                                hours. Installers showed up on time, were
                                extremely conscientious, and quickly completed
                                the work, cleaning up/hauling away when done.
                                There was no disruption to our normal operating
                                and no need for clean-up on our part. We found
                                Eric and his workers to be professional,
                                knowledgeable and extremely easy to work with.
                                Would definitely hire again
